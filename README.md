## 👋 Hi, I’m Anastasia (but you can call me Nastya)

🎓 I’m currently studying Python and AI at Picsart Academy
💡 I’m especially passionate about algorithms, clean code, and exploring how math powers intelligent systems
🧠 I have a background in C and computer science fundamentals
🔭 I recently completed a project where I re-implemented Python built-in functions from scratch to deepen my understanding of syntax and logic

🌱 I'm always learning — especially when it comes to:
- Problem solving with Python
- Mathematical modeling (sets, matrices, systems of equations)
- Functional programming, iterators, decorators, generators
- Clean and readable documentation

📂 Check out my first GitHub project: "Built-in Python Functions"

🌍 My goals:
- Build a solid portfolio in Python and AI
- Break into the tech industry with my first internship
- Connect with developers who love to learn deeply and share their knowledge
